# Introduction to object oriented programming
## What?
- a method of abstracting data
- allows us to bundle data together.
- allows us to use that bundle elsewhere
- allows us to reuse code written in that bundle(inheritance) for creating sub-bundles
- allows us to "glue" together data


## Why?
- to abstract data
- increased modularity
- to write less code(w/ inheritance)



## How?

- we create new classes
- we define methods(through functions) of that class
- these are private as the class is should only be used as an interface
- eveything data type we've used is a built in class
- we have instances of that class:
### Instances vs Classes
1234 is an instance of int
[1,2,3,4] is an instance of a list
(1,2) is an instance of a tuple
{"1":"hello"} is an instance of a dictionary
"hello world" is an instace of a string

all of the above are objects which are instances of a defined class. 
L = [1,2] creates a new instance(L) of a list
L.pop() is a method on THAT instance of a list.
